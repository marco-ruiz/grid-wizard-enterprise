</h3>
<p><i>March 3, 2009</i>
</p>
<p>The screencast <i><a href="media/gwe-intro-screencast.mov">'GWE Introductory and Basic Tutorial'</a>
</i>
 has been made available on the <i><a href="guides/resources.html">'Resources'</a>
</i>
 page on the project site.</p>
<p>Its goal is to give the viewer a hands on, end-to-end demonstration of the 'GWE experience'. This demo progressively addresses all aspects of such experience: GWE client and network setup, real experiment creation and submission, monitoring the execution progress of the experiment submitted (which GWE is running in parallel in the background) and finally browsing the experiment's results. Additionally it includes a small tour of the project's site to give the user a start up point on how to follow up on more advanced topics and detailed information. </p>
<p>Hopefully, this screencast will shed light on the balance and value added that GWE offers in terms on how easy it is to use and how much power it can bring to the user when trying to utilize cluster environments to run parameter exploration experiments.</p>

<div class="section"><h3><i>GWE 0.7.3.alpha Released</i>
</h3>
<p><i>March 2, 2009</i>
</p>
<p>GWE 0.7.3.alpha has been released. As with the previous release this one focus on productivity features, to follow up on the requests collected from NAMIC's AHM 2009 and the &quot;GWE Retreat&quot; that took place a couple of weeks ago. The most interesting feature in this release is the first draft of the new &quot;results browser&quot;. This feature allows the user to dynamically &quot;flip&quot; through their experiments' results from your &quot;orders&quot; web page (&quot;Web Control Panel&quot; GWE client). This seems a very nice addition to GWE and may set the tone for a future refactoring of the entire client interface to provide a richer experience to the end user. </p>
<p>Other features worth mentioning are the availability of more information in the web interface (including CSV and commands dumps and more detailed preview of orders) and the revamp of the cluster's resource manager infrastructure with capabilities to explicitly select a particular type of resource manager for a cluster (overwriting the auto-discovery feature) and a new driver to provide support for 'BSub' based resource managers (LSF, Lava). </p>
<p>The complete list of changes for this release can be found in the <i><a href="changes-report.html">release notes</a>

<div class="section"><h3><i>Retreat in Boston</i>
</h3>
<p><i>February 21, 2009</i>
</p>
<p>During this past week a retreat took place in Boston, Massachusetts to meet with researchers from the Surgical Planning Laboratory (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School) and NAMIC; in order to follow up on specific GWE related topics. </p>
<p>The meetings were extremely productive, lots of work was accomplished and a great deal of useful feedback was collected. Among the most interesting topics discussed were the future direction of GWE in terms of support for cloud computing (through services such as Amazon EC2) and the prototype and design of a sub system to allow researchers to publish and browse online the results of their parameter exploration experiments. </p>

<div class="section"><h3><i>GWE 0.7.2.alpha Released</i>
</h3>
<p><i>February 4, 2009</i>
</p>
<p>GWE 0.7.2.alpha has been released. Productivity features, as requested by users during NAMIC's AHM 2009, has been the focus of this release. Among the most popular ones implemented in this release we have: secure read of passwords and encrypted storage, configurable installation and database paths, order pause, resume and deletion and the ability to gather parameters for experiments from text files through a new P2EL function to <i><a href="guides/p2el-semantics.html#lines">parse text files</a>
</i>
. </p>
<p>Also, full access to XNAT systems has been implemented as an out-of-the-box library of P2EL macros; which rely on the XNAT REST API and XPath/XQuery for parsing the XML results. These macros will allow users to easily query experiments, sessions, scans, images and to stage (download) selected images. An intuitive example on how to use these macros to query, retrieve and process images from an XNAT system can be found in the <i><a href="guides/p2el-samples.html">&quot;P2EL Examples&quot;</a>
</i>
 page.</p>

<div class="section"><h3><i>GWE 0.7.1.alpha Released</i>
</h3>
<p><i>December 28, 2008</i>
</p>
<p>GWE 0.7.1.alpha has been released. This release includes the first release of a very useful and intuitive rich client application named &quot;Web Control Panel&quot;. This application is a full feature web application intended to provide an GUI interface to manage your GWE grid. A comprehensive <i><a href="guides/user-web.html">user documentation</a>
</i>
 has been included in the project site.</p>
<p>Another major item released in this version is the support for P2EL macros; which dramatically simplify the creation of P2EL statements. This infrastructure comes, out-of-the-box, with some useful macro definitions for medical imaging processes and Slicer3 usage. The project site has been updated with <i><a href="guides/config.html#Macro">configuration</a>
</i>
 and <i><a href="guides/p2el-macros.html">language specification</a>
</i>
 documentation for this item as well.</p>
<p>Finally, worth mentioning for this release, is the new <i><a href="guides/p2el-semantics.html#xpath">&quot;XPath Parser&quot;</a>
</i>
 P2EL function. This versatile function will allow end users to manipulate and query XML files easily and extract from them any information (typically to gather parameters to construct large parameter exploration experiments).</p>

<div class="section"><h3><i>Documentation Revamp</i>
</h3>
<p><i>December 28, 2008</i>
</p>
<p>As part of the effort to release GWE version 0.7.1.alpha, the project site documentation has been restructured (large pages broken down into smaller ones mainly), revamped with updated and more detailed information, and enriched with images and screenshots to help visualize the concepts described.</p>
<p>Also, a new <i><a href="media/gwe-basic-wcp-tutorial.ppt">power point tutorial</a>
</i>
 has been created for the new <i><a href="guides/user-web.html">&quot;Web Control Panel&quot;</a>
</i>
 application. Its link has been posted in the <i><a href="guides/quick.html#Tutorials">tutorials section of the quick start guide</a>
</i>
. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3><i>Tutorials Published</i>
</h3>
<p><i>December 9, 2008</i>
</p>
<p>Step by step tutorials have been created to describe how to get GWE and GSlicer3 up and running and how to use them to perform a few representative study cases. The advanced study case features how GWE queries images from the OASIS database, downloads them, process them and uploads the image resulting to remote file systems. You can find these tutorials in the <i><a href="guides/quick.html">'Tutorials' section of the 'Quick Start Guide'</a>
</i>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3><i>GWE 0.7.0.alpha Released</i>
</h3>
<p><i>November 30, 2008</i>
</p>
<p>GWE 0.7.0.alpha has been released. This release includes a major change in paradigm over the previous releases and consequently a lot of re-architecture. The scope of the project has been reduced to allow for faster releases, more practical features and easier usage. The main reduction is in the multi-user paradigm; which will no longer be used, leading to each user having its own dedicated daemon. This does not implies more effort to the end user; but actually the opposite since with the new architecture the installation of GWE daemon and other related backend systems has been automated and made transparent to the end user (check the trimmed down <i><a href="guides/quick.html">'Quick Start Guide'</a>
</i>
).</p>
<p>Also, the configuration has been trimmed down and made easier to read and manage, a default &quot;local cluster&quot; driver has been implemented to simulate a cluster out of the local machine (so users can start using GWE even without a cluster - ideal for small test orders or for powerful machines with multi cores and lots of memory) and the first draft of an execution profile framework has been implemented to support features such as job retries, executions timeouts, virtual file system clean up policy, etc. </p>
<p>Finally, the Slicer3 integration has been upgraded as well, so it can support all the new features. The complete list of changes for this release can be found in the <i><a href="changes-report.html">release notes</a>
</i>
 page. </p>

</h3>
<p><i>September 12, 2008</i>
</p>
<p>GWE was featured in the research paper titled <i><a href="media/miccaig.pdf">Simplifying the Utilization of Grid Computation using Grid Wizard Enterprise</a>

<div class="section"><h3><i>GWE 0.6.4.alpha Released</i>
</h3>
<p><i>August 27, 2008</i>
</p>
<p>GWE 0.6.4.alpha has been released. The main effort has been on P2EL; which has retired its previous version in favor of a new one; which has been syntactically and semantically redesign from scratch. The previous version of the language found its limitations in the face of requested features such as multidimensional variables, variables co-dependencies and aggregative function invocations. </p>
<p>So, old commands won't work anymore. To smooth the transition the new <i><a href="guides/p2el.html">'P2EL Guide'</a>
</i>
 describes in great detail the language's syntactic and semantic rules as well as all its features. We recommend reading the whole guide even when the language may seem intuitive enough. For each topic, the guide contains relevant examples to illustrate the concepts in a practical manner. Also, at the end of it the user can find some real P2EL commands to illustrate it in action.</p>
<p>The new P2EL architecture allows the easy creation of powerful pluggable functions. As part of this release a new one have been implemented (&quot;regexp&quot; - which works like the 'grep' unix command) and other 2 has been revamped (&quot;dir&quot; - old 'expand' function; but way more versatile and &quot;in&quot; - now allows to download entire directories). Please let us know of any other functions you may find useful to have in future releases. </p>
<p>A GWE daemon 0.6.4.alpha has been installed in the <i><a href="cluster/birn.html">BIRN cluster</a>
</i>
 and it is currently available for usage. The previous GWE daemon (version 0.6.3.alpha) has not been taken down for legacy purposes. Your particular GWE client is intelligent enough to connect to the correct daemon. If you wish to upgrade your current GWE client you can find instructions on how to do so in the <i><a href="guides/install.html#Updating">'Installation Guide'</a>
</i>

</div>
<div class="section"><h3><i>GWE 0.6.3.alpha Released</i>
</h3>
<p><i>June 19, 2008</i>
</p>
<p>GWE 0.6.3.alpha has been released. The main effort has been on P2EL; which has replaced its previous approach for expression semantics with a new specification for these as flexible, pluggable constructs, giving P2EL a great level of extensibility and cohesiveness. The GWE P2EL interpreter has been modified to comply with this specification. To the end user this translates to a more intuitive, robust and easy to learn and use language; and to the project team (and any other developers wishing to extend the language) to a more robust interpreter, clearer and more strict development guidelines for extending P2EL and more potential for the language as a whole.
