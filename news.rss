It is a maintenance release, which mainly includes robust security features to guarantee users' sensitive information (such as keystore and file system) is safe guarded using the latest security technologies, such as sandbox user environments, MD5 based symmetric keys and AES encryption. GWE terminal has been revamped as well with lots of inline editing friendly features. The complete list of changes for this release can be found in the &lt;{{{changes-report.html}release notes}}&gt; page. 

The GWE daemon running on the &lt;{{{cluster/birn.html}BIRN cluster}}&gt; has been updated with this version, so if you have been interacting with this "GWE Enabled" cluster, you will need to update your previous GWE client installation. Check the &lt;{{{guides/install.html#Updating}'Installation Guide'}}&gt; for details on how to do such update.

Useful feedback and feature requests (such as command pipelines) were collected.</description><category>gwe-project</category><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2008 22:54:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Slicer Integration Draft Released</title><description>GWE 0.6.1.alpha has been released bundled with a work-in-progress integration module to provide grid computing capabilities to &lt;&lt;{{{http://www.slicer.org/}3D Slicer}}&gt;&gt; by making accessible GWE features from within the Slicer UI. All the related details of this integration effort can be found in the &lt;{{{integration/slicer.html}'GWE-Slicer Integration' page}}&gt;.
